# 1.问题复现

在安装后 Debian 系统后，一般第一步都是执行`sudo apt update`，此时用的是自带的官方镜像源，速度很慢，所以我们会选择切换为国内的镜像源，这里以清华镜像源为例，默认已经配置好了清华镜像源。

在执行更新时：
```bash
sky@DESKTOP-IU948AR:~$ sudo apt update
[sudo] password for sky:

sky@DESKTOP-IU948AR:~$ sudo apt install ca-certificates

Package ca-certificates is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'ca-certificates' has no installation candidate
```

可以看出更新失败，需要我们安装`ca-certificates`，但是又无法成功安装`ca-certificates`。

# 2.解决办法

这个问题的核心是系统无法验证 HTTPS 源的证书，导致无法更新包管理器的索引或安装新软件包。这可能是因为系统缺少必要的 CA 证书或某些配置问题。

## 2.1 方式一：手动安装`ca-certificates`包

### 2.1.1 下载 DEB 包

1. 在另一台可以正常联网的机器上，访问 [Debian Packages](https://packages.debian.org/)。
2. 下载与系统版本匹配的 `ca-certificates` 包。例如，适用于 Bookworm 的链接可能是：
   ```
   https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/all/ca-certificates/download
   ```
3. 使用 USB 或其他方法将下载的 `.deb` 文件复制到你的系统。

### 2.1.2 手动安装包
在目标机器上运行以下命令：

```bash
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/ca-certificates*.deb
sudo apt update
```

### 2.2 方式二：临时禁用 HTTPS 验证（推荐）

可以尝试临时禁用 HTTPS 验证以更新软件源和安装 `ca-certificates`：

编辑 `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99disable-https-check` 文件：

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99disable-https-check
```

添加以下内容：

```plaintext
Acquire::https::Verify-Peer "false";
Acquire::https::Verify-Host "false";
```

保存后运行以下命令：

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates
```

安装完 `ca-certificates` 后，删除或注释掉该配置以恢复安全性。
